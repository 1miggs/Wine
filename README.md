# Wine
The wines that are made in Spain and important details 

I wrote this SQL database from the excel file I downloaded and chose only 154 lines of data to work with. 

In this SQL database I created a simple way to have better insights on the Wine and Wineries that produce said wine with important details regarding them.
I tried to stay away from outliers that would result in having a drastic wide range of data.

Much of the data that wasn't used was those that seemed to be almost repeats of data already used. 
Although no data within the original file containted repeats.

The following data can be seen as well in my Tableau Public profile.
